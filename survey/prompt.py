- {car_availability} is available for your use
- It's currently {season}

Based on these factors, which mode of transportation would you choose?
Respond with:

2 for bike
3 for transit
4 for car""",
    41: """We like to analyze the influence of the variables: distance, car availability, and season (or weather) on commuting mode choice. 
Age is also considered as an explanatory variable, although it has been found to be not significant for public transport.
- Distance to school is {distance} km.
- Car availability is {car_availability}.
- The weather is {season} (fair or bad).
- The student is {age} years old.

Based on the influence of the above variables, what is your commuting mode choice? Respond with:
1 for walking
2 for cycling
3 for public transport
4 for car/motorcycle.""",

#comments for #9:
#3. **Key Findings:**
  # - For each additional $1.00 that one pays per ounce of beer, an individual is willing to pay a premium of 7.4 cents per ounce for the sustainable version.
  # - Personal demographics account for only about 9% of the R-squared decomposition and are statistically insignificant in predicting WTP.
   #- Younger individuals and those with lower levels of education are willing to pay more for sustainable beer.
  # - Contrary to other studies, factors such as having children or the location of residence do not significantly influence WTP.
#Based on these findings, consider the following questions:
#1. What attributes define a sustainable consumer in the context of this study?
#2. How do personal demographics influence the willingness to pay for sustainable beer, if at all?
#3. What implications do these findings have for breweries looking to market sustainable beer to different consumer segments?
#4. How can the insights from this analysis inform future research on consumer behavior regarding sustainable products?
#1. **Dependent Variable:** The dependent variable in this analysis is the amount per ounce that a respondent would be willing to pay above the typical price of their favorite beer, referred to as WTP for sustainable beer (in $/oz).
#- Environmental awareness
#- Consumption habits
#- Other relevant attributes
#- Demographic factors (e.g., age, gender, education, political leaning, marital status, household residency, and whether you live in a rural, urban, or suburban setting):
    9: """Willingness-to-pay (WTP) for sustainable beer is binary WTP (0 or 1), where a value of 1 indicates that you are willing to pay for sustainable beer, and a value of 0 indicates that you are not. 
How does your WTP for sustainable beer vary across different independent variables? Consider the following aspects:
Your age category is {age_category}.  
Your educational attainment is as follows: {education_summary}.
Your income is {income_summary}.

Recycling behavior: whether you recycle (Recycle_Yes).
Number of beers you report consuming: {buying_descriptions}.
You have indicated the following regarding your environmental contributions: {environmental_contribution_descriptions}.
Respond with 1 if you are willing to pay for sustainable beer, and a value of 0 if you are not.
